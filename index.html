        <h1> Run to the Hills</h1>
        <p>White man came across the sea<br>
            He brought us pain and misery<br>
            He killed our tribes, he killed our creed<br>
            He took our game for his own need<br>
        </p>
        <p>We fought him hard, we fought him well<br>
            Out on the plains, we gave him hell<br>
            But many came, too much for Cree<br>
            Oh, will we ever be set free?
        </p>
